Hello All,

I enjoy helping when I can, just need to know what needs to be done. 

Html/Css was used in the past to create sites like Rollyworld, packratsorganizing, Quantaconn, and a few forgotten others üòè \
From Jan \`21 to Dec \`22 I dove into Python to create a [Vod Directory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I14FTwkta4p3Y4oiMcRhT6gPvyyH5ed1PXzbqokxLO8/edit?gid=709036877#gid=709036877) \
Diving into Minecraft Modpack started around June \`23.
