# hello-world

Hello All,

I enjoy helping when I can, just need to know what needs to be done. 

I do have experience with Java, but it is not extensive. 
Html/Css was a thing of the past but I am sure I can pick it up easily again.

Main focus here will be to help the PoGo Community with any of the time or resources I have available.
